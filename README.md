## Installation

Myg on Rails works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'myg-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install myg

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'myg', github: 'jonhue/myg-rails'
```

Now run the generator

    $ rails g myg:install

Then add [Myg](https://github.com/jonhue/myg) to your asset pipeline:

```js
//= require myg
```
```css
/*
 *= require myg
 */
```

**Note:** If you are using a package manager like Yarn, make sure to fetch the latest versions instead.
